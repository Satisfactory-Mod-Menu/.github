## Satisfactory Mod Menu — When the Factory Starts Listening

Belts sing in endless loops.
Smelters glow like patient suns.
And logic stretches outward, tile by tile, toward something almost infinite.

The **Satisfactory Mod Menu** is not a way to skip the journey — it is a way to *hear it more clearly*. A quiet panel beside the clatter, letting you shape the rhythm of production without dulling its complexity.

Built for pioneers of **Satisfactory**, this mod menu offers refined control over time, space, and resources — without tearing the fabric of your save.

## 🧭 Overview — What the Mod Menu Truly Is

This is not a single-button miracle.
It is a **modular command interface**, injected only while the game is running, working purely in memory.

**Design intentions:**

* Remove friction, not challenge
* Accelerate creativity, not shortcuts
* Give absolute control — with instant reversal

Think of it as an architect’s console, hovering gently above the factory floor.

## ⚙️ Production & Speed Modules

In Satisfactory, time is the most expensive material.

The production section lets you bend it — carefully.

**Factory control features include:**

* Global & per-machine speed multipliers ⚙️
* Instant crafting and hand-building
* Zero power consumption toggle
* Machine efficiency overrides
* Pause / resume production chains

All values are slider-based, ensuring stability even in sprawling megabases.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Per-machine tuning prevents production desyncs in large conveyor networks.

## 🧱 Building Freedom & World Control

The planet is vast.
Your ideas are larger still.

**World and construction tools:**

* Infinite building materials
* Free build (no cost, no limits)
* Fly mode & no-clip camera
* Movement speed control
* Fall damage disable

Ideal for megabase planning, vertical layouts, and stress-free exploration across biomes.

## 👁 Resource Visibility & Planning Insight

A growing factory needs clarity.

The mod menu provides vision — quietly.

**Awareness modules include:**

* Resource node highlights 👁
* Storage container fill indicators
* Item flow overlays
* Global scan toggles

Everything is configurable, fade-based, and designed to inform — not overwhelm.
